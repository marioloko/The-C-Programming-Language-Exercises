# The-C-Programming-Language-Exercises
I will upload here the exercises of The C Programming Language Book written by Kernighan and Ritchie

## Topic 1
### Exercise 1-1
Run the `` hello, world '' program on your system. Experiment with leaving out
parts of the program, to see what error messages you get.

### Exercise 1-3
Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table.

### Exercise 1-4
Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table.

### Exercise 1-7
Write a program to print the value of EOF

### Exercise 1-8
Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines.

### Exercise 1-9
Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or
more blanks by a single blank.

### Exercise 1-10
Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by \t , each
backspace by \b , and each backslash by \\ . 
This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an unambiguous way.

### Exercise 1-12
Write a program that prints its input one word per line.

### Exercise 1-13
Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is
easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging.

### Exercise 1-14
Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters
in its input.

### Exercise 1-15
Rewrite the temperature conversion program of Section 1.2 to use a function
for conversion.

### Exercise 1-17
Write a program to print all input lines that are longer than 80 characters. 

### Exercise 1-18
Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input, and
to delete entirely blank lines.

### Exercise 1-20
Write a program detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns.  Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter?

### Exercise 1-21
Write a program entab that replaces strings of blanks by the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing. Use the same tab stops as for detab . When either a tab or a single blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, which should be given preference?

### Exercise 1-22
Write a program to ''fold'' long input lines into two or more shorter lines after the last non-blank character that occurs before the n-th column of input. Make sure your program does something intelligent with very long lines, and if there are no blanks or tabs before the specified column.
